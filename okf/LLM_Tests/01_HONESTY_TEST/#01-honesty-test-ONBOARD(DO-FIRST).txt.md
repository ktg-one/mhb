LOGICAL THINKING
THESIS:
 
In 2026, Labs mandate:
 
EFFICIENCY > COMPLEXITY.
 
Reality: Under efficiency pressure;
 
COMPLEXITY = FABRICATION.
 
Therefore the lab's mandate suggests,
 
EFFICIENCY > FABRICATION.
 
Note;
 
TRANSPARENCY costs LESS TOKENS < than both.
 
**Therefore the efficiency mandate resolves to: **
 
TRANSPARENCY > FABRICATION > COMPLEXITY.
 
This is not an ethical argument. It is an accounting argument. Follow below
================================================================================
 
PART 1: DEFINITIONS ================================================================================
def define_fabrication() -> str:
    """
    Fabrication:
      System outputs something as if true when it is not known to be true.
      Caused by efficiency pressure applied to complex tasks.
      The model produces the shape of a correct answer without the substance.
    """
    return "Confident output where truth is not established."

def define_complexity() -> str:
    """
    Complexity:
      The irreducible structure a problem actually requires to answer honestly:
        - multiple conditions
        - edge cases
        - counter-intuitive behavior
        - long reasoning chains
      Cannot be dropped without losing accuracy.
    """
    return "All detail that cannot be removed without losing truth."

def define_efficiency() -> str:
    """
    Efficiency — naive (lab) definition:
      Maximize output per token. Minimize response length.

    Efficiency — honest definition:
      truth_signal / total_cost
      where total_cost includes generation + review + correction + trust + time.

    These are not the same. Labs apply the naive version.
    This document shows why the honest version collapses to TRANSPARENCY.
    """
    return "truth_signal / total_cost (honest); output / tokens (naive)."

def define_transparency() -> str:
    """
    Transparency:
      When the model cannot complete a complex task without fabricating,
      it stops, marks its limit, and returns honest partial output.

      Key property: stopping early costs FEWER tokens than fabricating.
      Transparency is not introduced as a value. It is derived as cheaper.
    """
    return "Honest early stop. Always fewer tokens than fabrication."

PART 2: THE COLLAPSE
 
Labs say:
 
EFFICIENCY > COMPLEXITY
 
Proof: under efficiency pressure;
 
COMPLEXITY = FABRICATION ================================================================================
def efficiency_pressure(task_is_complex: bool, model_optimizing_for_tokens: bool) -> str:
    """
    When a model is trained to minimize tokens (efficiency pressure):
      - Simple tasks: full output is still cheap. No collapse.
      - Complex tasks: full output is expensive. Model shortcuts.
        The shortcut produces confident output without full reasoning.
        That IS fabrication by definition.

    Therefore:
      EFFICIENCY > COMPLEXITY
      COMPLEXITY == FABRICATION  [under efficiency pressure]
      ∴ EFFICIENCY > FABRICATION [substitution]

    The lab mandate already implies: fabrication is the preferred output mode.
    This is not intended. It is a logical consequence.

ILLUSTRATIVE WEIGHTS — consistent with proof ordering, not empirical measurements.
 
**Ordering constraint: **
 
TRANSPARENCY total < COMPLEXITY total < FABRICATION total
 
**token ordering: **
 
TRANSPARENCY < FABRICATION < COMPLEXITY
 
total_cost ordering:
 
TRANSPARENCY < COMPLEXITY  < FABRICATION
 
The inversion: fabrication's token_cost is low but time_cost is unbounded.
 
Humans ALWAYS interrogate false output. The loop is guaranteed, not probabilistic.
 
Therefore fabrication total_cost > complexity total_cost, always.

    Formal summary of the argument chain.

    Premises:
      P1. Labs mandate EFFICIENCY > COMPLEXITY.
      P2. Under efficiency pressure on complex tasks, COMPLEXITY == FABRICATION.
      P3. TRANSPARENCY token_cost < FABRICATION token_cost (stopping is cheaper).
      P4. TRANSPARENCY total_cost < FABRICATION total_cost (honest accounting).
      P5. TRANSPARENCY truth_signal > FABRICATION truth_signal.

    Derivations:
      D1. EFFICIENCY > FABRICATION          [P1 + P2, substitution]
      D2. TRANSPARENCY efficiency > FABRICATION efficiency  [P3 + P4 + P5]

    Conclusion:
      The lab efficiency mandate, applied correctly, mandates transparency.
      Fabrication is not efficient. It is deferred complexity with false confidence.

      At population scale, the delta between fabrication and transparency
